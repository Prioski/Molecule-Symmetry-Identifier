This program is designed to assist in identifying the point groups of molecules with basic geometries.
At the moment it supports linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, trigonal bipyramidal and octahedral geometries. Other geometries may be added eventually.
An element can be selected at the end of each bond. As it stands there is no way to select other basic groups that involve various atoms such as a methyl or phenyl groups. This is planned for a potential future update.
